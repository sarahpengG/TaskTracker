        I’m a sophomore at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Computer
        Science and minoring in UX Design. In my free time, I enjoy drawing and
        painting, and I’m currently learning 3D modeling and animation. Whether
        it’s coding, sketching, or shaping 3D objects, I’m always excited to
        learn and create.
