## Reflection

  This project was created as a hands-on way to learn React basics, particularly useState, props, and component structure.

  I set out to build a simple task manager where I could practice CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) while keeping the code modular and readable.

  One of the challenges was structuring state management between parent (TaskWrapper) and child components (TaskForm, Todo). Lifting state up in React and correctly typing props in TypeScript took extra practice.
  React + Vite/Create React App, Fast setup and modular component architecture.

  TypeScript, Added type safety to catch errors early.

  UUID, For generating unique task IDs.
